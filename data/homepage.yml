  title: "Who am I?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    Being a software developer is what makes me happy. Over the years I have always cultivated
    many interests and will continue to do so, I like reading and learning new things that I have never done before.
    The feeling of learning a new skill is priceless.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    I wish I could have the opportunity to improve every day, even a little, but have the opportunity to grow.
    I had experiences abroad, I lived in other Italian cities, I was an Erasmus student,
    I understood the value that people have and how much sharing can give us.
    Sharing is the key to growing and living better.
